Miniprof 0.0.1
==============

Miniprof is a small function profiler designed for predictable low-latency
operation. It aims to help profiling in a real-time environment.  Here are
design features:

 * Uses -function-instrument feature of GCC
 * Pre-allocate ringbuffer to avoid malloc() in the fast path
 * Use clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW) to have precise and
   fast nanosecond timestamp across cores
 * Enable, disable and reset at runtime

The current implementation is not thread-safe. It means that if multiple
threads executes instrumented functions while tracing is enabled, then behavior
is undefined.

See src/demo.c and src/Makefile.am for operation and linking options.

Have fun!
